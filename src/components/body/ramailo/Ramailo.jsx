                Ramailo after School is a project-based learning program for
                students aged 10 to 15 that involves cooking, reading aloud,
                Reader's Theatre, creative writing, educational board games, and
                other activities. We think that a genuine connection between
                teaching and learning in and out of school develops children's
                core talents, such as cognitive, social, physical, emotional,
                and spiritual growth, decision-making and problem-solving
                skills, cooperative learning, and many more. Every Saturday
                afternoon, students may take a break from their studies and join
                our Recreational Centre for some fun. Ramailo after School could
                be a great place for students to get all of their experiential
                learning opportunities, which will certainly benefit their
                academic performance and self-esteem.

              <p className="">
                Reading aloud to youngsters establishes a solid foundation for
                language development. Reading aloud is given importance to
                engage students and encourage them to hear the author's voice
                louder, dive deeper into the story, feel it, and relate it to
                their own life experiences. Teachers and parents must read
                authentic (non-pedagogical) books to their children regularly to
                help them develop their literacy skills.

              <h1 className="r3">Reader’s Theatre and Puppet Show</h1>
              <p className="">
                Children practice reading aloud and getting ready to act out a
                story before performing Reader's Theatre and acting it out
                during the Puppet Show. Reader's Theatre and Puppet Shows help
                to bring the book to life by allowing participants to convey
                specific characters' emotions by immersing themselves in the
                story and playing it out with facial expressions. These
                activities can also aid in the development of literacy skills in
                children.
